Manchester United Football Club is a professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester,
 England, that currently competes in the Premier League, 
the top flight of English football. Founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, 
the club changed its name to Manchester United in 1902 and moved to 
Old Trafford in 1910.<br><br>

Manchester United have won 20 league titles, the most of any English club, 11 FA Cups, four League Cups and
 a record 20 FA Community Shields. The club has 
also won three European Cups, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, 
one Intercontinental Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup. In 1998–99, the club 
became the first in the history of British football to achieve the treble of the Premier League, 
the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League.<br><br>

The 1958 Munich air disaster claimed the lives of eight players.
 In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, Manchester United became the first English 
football club to win the European Cup.
Sir Alex Ferguson won 38 trophies, including 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups and
 2 UEFA Champions Leagues, between 
1986 and 2013, when he announced his retirement.
 Louis van Gaal is the club's current manager after Ferguson's successor David Moyes was sacked after only 
10 months in charge.<br><br>

Manchester United was the second highest-earning football club in the world for 2013–14,
 with an annual revenue of €518 million, and the world's third most 
valuable football club in 2015, valued at $1.98 billion.
 As of June 2015, it is the world's most valuable football brand, estimated to be worth $1.2 billion.
 It is one of the most widely supported football teams in the world.
 After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was purchased by 
Malcolm Glazer in May 2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost £800 million, 
after which the company was taken private again. In August 2012, 
Manchester United made an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.
 The club holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably with 
Liverpool and with Manchester City.<br><br>
